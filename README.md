# GitHub-Actions-Practice
A sample repo to practice using GitHub Actions for Javascript

Set-Up
The first part of this set-up is taken from Ania Kub√≥w. If you'd rather follow along with a YouTube tutorial, please watch her video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COPS4VMfaUc


1. Fork and clone this repo onto your local machine.

2. Move into the GitHub-Actions-Practice directory you created and make a new package.json for this project by typing the following into your terminal:
   $ npm init -y

3. Create a directory for your actions by typing the following into your terminal:
   $ touch action.yml

4. Install @actions/github by entering into your terminal:
   $ npm install @actions/github

4. Install @actions/core by entering into your terminal:
   $ npm install @actions/core

5. Open up the action.yml file and paste the following sample code from GitHub Docs:

/////

    name: 'Hello World'
    description: 'Greet someone and record'
    inputs:
        who-to-greet: # id of input
        required: true
        default: 'World'
    outputs:
        time: # id of output
        description: 'The time we greeted you'
    runs:
        using: 'node12'
        main: 'index.js'

//////

    Notice that both who-to-greet and time are variables that are set to the id of input and output, respectively. We are able to use variables here because we downloaded @actions/core allowing multiple action files to interact.

6. Since the action we just created runs on 'index.js', we will need to add an index.js file to our directory.

7. Call @actions/core and @actions/github within index.js with the following code at the top of the file:

    const core = require('@actions/core');
    const github = require('@actions/github');

8. Copy and paste the sample code into your new index.js file.

//////////

    // this is the file that will be run by action.yml
    try {
        // `who-to-greet` input defined in action metadata file action.yml
        const nameToGreet = core.getInput('who-to-greet');
        console.log(`Hello ${nameToCreet}!`);
        const time = (new Date()).toTimeString();
        core.setOutput("time", time);
        // Get the JSON webhook payload for the event that triggered the workflow
        const payload = JSON.stringify(github.context.payload, undefined, 2)
        console.log(`The event payload: ${payload}`);
    } catch (error) {
        core.setFailed(error.message);
    }
